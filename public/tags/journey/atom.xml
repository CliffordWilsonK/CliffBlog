      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, welcome to the beginning of my story. I’m Clifford — an 18-year-old Ghanaian who decided he’s not just going to use technology… I’m going to build with it, shape it, and hopefully disrupt a few industries while I’m at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Growing up (around 12 years old), I always wondered how games were built. One day I had an epiphany (🤣 or anyhow you would like to call it).&#xA;I decided to learn how to build my own games, and that what exactly is stopping me?&#xA;(Other than ECG sometimes… but we move.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
