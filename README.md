# **📚 Clifford’s Tech Blog**

Welcome to the repository that holds my personal tech blog — a place where I document my journey as a young Ghanaian developer navigating coding, startups, faith, and everything in between.

This repo contains my articles, drafts, notes, and ideas as I grow from beginner to full-stack engineer (and eventually startup founder).
