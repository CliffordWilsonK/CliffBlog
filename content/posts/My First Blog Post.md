If you’re reading this, welcome to the beginning of my story. I’m Clifford — an 18-year-old Ghanaian who decided he’s not just going to use technology… I’m going to build with it, shape it, and hopefully disrupt a few industries while I’m at it.

Growing up (around 12 years old), I always wondered how games were built. One day I had an epiphany (🤣 or anyhow you would like to call it).
I decided to learn how to build my own games, and that what exactly is stopping me?
(Other than ECG sometimes… but we move.)

How I Entered the Tech World

My journey didn’t start with some fancy laptop or a Silicon Valley mentor.
It started with curiosity… and YouTube tutorials loading at 240p on my Mom's phone.

I started binge watching Brackeys (Unity Game Engine tutorials) then later I shifted my focus to Web Development
I began with HTML and CSS, making tiny websites (I still have a laugh when I visit this site🥰 - https://kingofprogramming.netlify.app/) that honestly looked like 2010 internet nostalgia. But it felt magical — the moment I wrote code and something actually appeared on the screen, I knew this was it.

From there I moved into Python, then Django, and suddenly the idea of building real web apps wasn’t far-fetched anymore.

Where I Am Now


Right now, I’m juggling:
- Learning software engineering properly
- Building apps with Django and React
- Studying for school
- And dreaming of launching a startup from Ghana that goes global

Sometimes it feels overwhelming. Sometimes I’m hyped.
Sometimes my laptop decides to misbehave and test my Christian patience.
But this is the grind. This is the journey.

The Challenges? Oh, Plenty.

- Slow internet (Ghana WiFi is like a spiritual battle sometimes).
- Limited resources.
- Feeling behind others online. Mostly I feel embarassed to share my small progresses
- Wondering if I’ll ever reach FAANG or build something worth billions.

But here’s the mindset change that saved me:
Tech has no gatekeepers anymore. Your location doesn’t define your ceiling — your consistency does.

My Big Vision

I’m not learning tech just for vibes.
I want to:

Build powerful apps
Start my own company
Create something meaningful
And use tech to win souls and help people

Yeah, I know — big goals.
But you know what? Every big tech founder started with a small, shaky step.

This is mine.

Why I’m Starting This Blog

Simple:
I want to document my journey — the wins, the failures, the bugs that nearly made me cry, the ideas that might become something huge one day.

If you’re a young Ghanaian (or anywhere around the world) trying to enter tech, I hope my posts help you feel less alone.

Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned already, it’s this:
You don’t need permission to start. You just need to start.

And this… is the start.
